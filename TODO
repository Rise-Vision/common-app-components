Rise Vision:
  What I did yesterday:
    ✔ Standup
    ✔ Scrum of Scrums
  What I will work on today:
    ☐ Validate common-app-components changes are enough (canAccessApps)
    ☐ Validate Storage and Store endpoints updates
    ☐ Add password validation logic
  Retrospection:
    **My role in the company: 2/5** | Same
    - (+) Backend code is pretty stable at this point, with good test coverage
    - (-) Unexpected issues with basic building blocks in the frontend
    - (-) Bad effort estimations affect the whole epic

    -----

    **The company: 3/5** | Same

    - (+) Finished Peer Reviews
    - (-) Authentication epic taking longer than expected
    - (-) Repository explosion. Wondering if some repositories actually make sense on their own (common-app-components looks like it could be part of common-header)

    -----

    **Improvements**

    - Evaluate Docker for simplifying dev environment setup/deployment
    - Evaluate Yarn/NPM 4, mainly for version locks (to avoid transitive dependency updates, which cause unexpected breaks)
